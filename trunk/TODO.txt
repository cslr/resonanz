TODO

- refactor main.cpp more to make code more readable and clear, 
  there are also small bugs and assumptions as code is not 100% perfect

- add better support for "themes" stimulation mechanisms are divided into themes
  (subdirectories) that can be activated by copying stimulation files that are used
  into main directory

- once Emotiv Insight is available write real EmotivInsightDataSource class instead
  of using EmotivInsightStub and random data

- once Muse is available,
  sample at 200 Hz to get 0-100 hz band for EEG for analysis 
  to get: gamma/alpha/beta/theta bands for target analysis

- gradually replace strict-licensed material and create database of pictures 
  that are in public domain or under VERY liberal licenses 
  (non-restrictive Creative Commons license).
  this will then make it easy to use resulting movies in anyway.

- testing

- user interface: write Java SWT (eclipse) user interface for 
  those that cannot used command-line [much later as you need lots of experimentation]

STIMULATION: 

- (picture-based) stimulation needs more high-quality pictures
  [pictures causing calmness]

  *YOU NEED *STRONG* PICTURES* IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET ANY REAL EFFECT*

- licensing mess: REMOVE media files that require 
  ShareAlike (same license as the original) instead of just Attribution

  [This means that you can distribute the resulting movie commercially]

- study available sound instrument software codes for Linux (and Windows),
  VST host/instruments afaik do not support easy setting/fetching of patch
  parameters so it is not good solution but other sound synthesizer 
  architechtures might actually do this

- study psycle and use (or implement) some better sound synthesizers,
  more advanced post processing (filter cutoff [low/highpass filtering 
  using fftw])

- look at LADSPA plugins, VST plugins are not very good because 
  you cannot easily manipulate and fetch synthesizer plugin parameters 
  from the host (use as the simulator)

- word stimulation needs to be rapid and needs 
  something extra to maximize the impact, try to get text2speech working?

- later: algorithmic music might make sense
