Another interesting ones to look at:

  * computer-controlled electroacupuncture
  * computer-controlled tens/ems is more non-invasive
  * software synths: ladspa plugins (linux), vst plugins are not that easily "remotely controllable" from another software

Also non-EEG based feedback methods might make sense.
